# Welcome to the Wall of the Dead

This is where the breadcrumb trail of project pass-offs live.

This repository will hold the exit checklists for all employees who have gone before.  If you wanted to know who worked on projects in the past, you can find that information here. (This repository is similar to the Book of Omni in the Book of Mormon where the plates were passed from one individual to another).

>"And now I, Amaron, write the things whatsoever I write, which are few, in the book of my father...And it came to pass that I did deliver the plates unto my brother Chemish... Now I, Chemish, write what few things I write, in the same book with my brother; for behold, I saw the last which he wrote, that he wrote it with his own hand; and he wrote it in the day that he delivered them unto me. And after this manner we keep the records, for it is according to the commandments of our fathers. And I make an end. Behold, I, Abinadom, am the son of Chemish..." (Omni 1:4, 8-10).
